We thought of an idea why not to have an app or website that will have a user friendly interaction in which each element describes something weather it is the colour or the concept, With this idea we continue for a prototype that will use some parameters that are the sure signs of depression in a person, So the prototype demands the parameter in percentage ranging method(PRM) ,these parameters are also verified by the world health organisation (WHO) .
The model gives the outcome of the level of depression a person have on the basis of some sure symptoms ,and the process output comes with an efficiency of 94.7%.
So, through this model we can help number of lifes throughout the globe.
